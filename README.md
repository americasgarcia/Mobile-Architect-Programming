For this course, I created the Weight Tracker App. This was my first time ever building a full app from start to finish in Android Studio, so it was a completely new experience for me. The main goal of my app was to help users stay consistent with their fitness goals by logging their daily weight and getting positive encouragement when they hit certain milestones. I wanted it to feel supportive and realistic, something people could actually use every day without feelihg pressured. 
When I started thinking about the user experience, I tried to imagine what would make me want to use a tracking app. I know how easy it is to lose motivation when things feel complicated, so I focused on making the layout clean and easy to navigate. My app includes a log in screen, a weight log with a clear grid layout, and an SMS permission pop-up that allows users to receive goal notifications. I chose calm colors and a minimal design to make it feel approchable instead of intimidating. I think the design worked because it keeps the focus on small progress, it's encouraging without being overwhelming, which is something I really wanted users to feel. 
Since this was my first experience using Android Studio, I had to learn a lot as I went. I took things one step at a time, setting up the layout, then adding functionality, and then testing everything repeatedly. I used comments in my code so I could remember what each part did later, which saved me more than once. I also learned how important it is to test as I go instead of waiting until the end. It made fixing issues way less stressful. This project taught me a lot about problem-solving and how to break big tasks down into smaller manageable pieces. 
One of the challenges I faced was setting up the SMS permission system. I had to go through a few errors before figuring out how to make it request permission without crashing or breaking the rest of the app. Once I got it working, it felt like a huge win. I also had to play around with layouts to make sure everything looked right on different screens. That part really pushed me to think more about how users experience an app visually, not just how it functions behind the scenes. 
The biggest thing I took away from this project is confidence! I started this class feeling unsure about how to even begin an app, and now I can say I've built one that actually works and I do feel very proud of that accomplishment. I also feel like I've developed a better balance between design and development. My biggest strength in this project was keeping the app user-centered and simple. I learned that a good app doesn't have to be packed with features, it just has to work well and make people want to use it.
